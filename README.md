# Yearly GDP growth of major African Countries 

## Predicting/Tracking increases of GDP in Africa regionally (analyzed as North, West, South, East and Middle Africa)

**Author: Alpha Kaba**

#### Business Problem: There is severe financial discrepancies regionally when you take a quick browse at Africa and I wanted to detail how severe those discrepancies were and why they exist.

DATA: African Economic data that includes key features that equate to a countries overall performance such as Household final consumption expenditure, Exports of goods and services, GDP, etc.

## Methods

> Data preparation for modeling: Cleaning(duplicates, etc.), Feature Engineering (Creating a regional column to use to explain my insights through that lense), addressing inconsistent categories, etc.

> Visualizations: (regplot, despine, etc.) to gain a further understanding of African economics

> ML models of choice: KNN, Linear Regression

**RESULTS**
