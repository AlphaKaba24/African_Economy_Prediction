# Yearly GDP growth of major African Countries 

## Predicting/Tracking increases of GDP in Africa regionally (analyzed as North, West, South, East and Middle Africa)

**Author: Alpha Kaba**

#### Business Problem: There is severe financial discrepancies regionally when you take a quick browse at Africa and I wanted to detail how severe those discrepancies were and why they exist.

DATA: African Economic data that includes key features that equate to a countries overall performance such as Household final consumption expenditure, Exports of goods and services, GDP, etc.

## Methods

> Data preparation for modeling: Cleaning(duplicates, etc.), Feature Engineering (Creating a regional column to use to explain my insights through that lense), addressing inconsistent categories, etc.

> Visualizations: (regplot, despine, etc.) to gain a further understanding of African economics

> ML models of choice: KNN, Linear Regression

**RESULTS**

**African GDP Growth Regionally**

>North African Countries experience an explosion of GDP growth year after year especially compared to other regions. It makes sense when you consider it includes Economic powerhouses like Egypt for instance.


**Correlation between Household Financial Income and GDP Growth**

>Household Financial income obviously plays a big part in igniting an economic spark. When countries generally have more spending power, they typically (not always) have thriving economies.


## Model
